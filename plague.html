				<img src="newspaper.jpg" alt="newspaper" align="left" hspace="10">
				<p><em>1918 </em> was the year that The Great War would end bringing some form of peace to Europe. Before this could happen though, an epidemic broke out. This was not just contained to one country or even a continent but the whole world suffered. 50 million people died in such a small amount of time (a higher body count than the war itself). It was not only the elderly or the ill that suffered but healthy men and women died due to this type of influenza.</p>
